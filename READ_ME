Run the python program "term_project" 

For my term project I looked at data from shark attacks. I gathered my data from the global shark attack 
ﬁle from  https://www.sharkattackﬁle.net/incidentlog.htm. I wanted to predict/classify if an unprovoked 
attack would be fatal or not with respect to features such as the country, species of shark, activity being 
performed, age of the person aDacked, and sex (M/F) of the person aDacked. The classiﬁers I looked at 
were logistic regression, naive Bayesian, decision tree, random forest, and kNN. I also looked at Random 
forests with just features like the country of the attack, species of shark, and activity being performed. 
The data cleaning that I performed included making some assumptions and ﬁltering the data. What I 
have taken away from this project is to stay out of the water, and to not take up surﬁng.  

Random Forest with all of the features was the most accurate at 86.6% followed by Random Forest with 
Age and Sex features dropped at 86.2%. The best TPR and TNR was logistic regression. The least accurate 
was the decision tree classiﬁer. It was interesting to see that the true negative ratio wasn’t good for this 
dataset/training set. The random forest did the worst for TNR. The worst TPR was also Random Forest 
without age and sex features.
